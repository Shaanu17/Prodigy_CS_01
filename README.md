Task-01 :- 
In this project i created a Python program from pre-defined  libraries that can encrypt and decrypt text using the Caesar Cipher algorithm. IT allow users to input a message and a shift value to perform encryption and decryption.

The Caesar Cipher is one of the simplest and oldest encryption algorithms. It is a substitution cipher where each letter in the plaintext is "shifted" by a certain number of positions down or up the alphabet

How to Run the Program:-  Save the Code in notepad or vs code or in pycharm .
Open a text editor or an IDE (like VS Code, PyCharm, or even Notepad).
Copy the above Python code into the editor.
Save the file with a .py extension.
 In Windows: Open Command Prompt (CMD)
In Mac/Linux: Open Terminal.Use the cd command to change to the directory where you saved the Python script.
Execute the Python script by running : python caeser.py.(You can use your filename on your cmd by using python filename.
